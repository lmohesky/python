# Python

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that I've created for various purposes, including automation, data analysis, web scraping, and more. Each script is well-documented and follows best practices for coding in Python.

## Contents

- **automation**: Scripts for automating repetitive tasks, such as file management, system operations, and more.
- **data_analysis**: Scripts for data analysis and visualization, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models.
- **web_scraping**: Scripts for scraping data from websites, including tools for parsing HTML and navigating through web pages.
- **utilities**: General-purpose utility scripts for tasks like text processing, file conversions, and more.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you'll need Python 3 installed on your system. Each script can be run from the command line, and many of them accept command-line arguments for customization. Detailed usage instructions are provided in the docstrings at the beginning of each script.
